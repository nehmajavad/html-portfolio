<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Nehma Javad. I am a responsible, hard working, stay at home mom who is eager to retunrn to the workforce. 
  I have a postgraduate degree in computer applications. As a stay at home I have good experience in multitasking which 
  results in a smooth run operation. You must be wondering why a housewife would want to venture into the world of website development. For me, it's about more than just 
  learning a new skill â€“ it's about empowerment, 
  creativity, and carving out a space for myself in the ever-evolving tech industry.
  Thank you for joining me on this digital adventure, and I can't wait to see where it leads us!

Warmest wishes,
Nehma Javad
